The school service of the university of Copenhagen contaced me and asked me to
code three small games that asked the player to perform different cognitive
tasks. The games uses [processing.js](http://processingjs.org) and run on any
smartphone. The games can be found at this url:
[rotendahl.dk/games/brain](http://rotendahl.dk/games/brain)


### The platform
The games consist of several _.pde_ files and is put an a html canvas with the
help of processing. The games were made responsive with the help of this repo
[jProcessingJS](https://github.com/GildasP/jProcessingJS)


If you want to read more about the games and how it was working with processing
