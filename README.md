# Brain based smartphone web-games
![screenshot.png](screenshot.png)

This is a project for the School Service of The university of Copenhagen.
I made three small games aimed at kids that asked them to perform different
cognitive tasks. The games uses [processing.js](http://processingjs.org) and
runs on any smartphone. The games can be found at this url:

### The platform
The games consist of several _.pde_ files and is put an a html canvas by
processing. The games were made responsive with the help of this repo
[jProcessingJS](https://github.com/GildasP/jProcessingJS)


If you want to read more about the games and more about building responsive
smartphone games with processing I've written a post about it
